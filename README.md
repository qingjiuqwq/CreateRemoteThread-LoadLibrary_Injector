# Windows Injector
The simplest Windows injector you could make
## Compilation
To inject x64 DLL's into x64 processes, you should use x64 pointers.
But as you are using handles instead of pointers, the compiler can take care of its length instead of you.
So compiling this injector into x64 if you will be able to inject only x64 DLL's into x64 processes,
compiling into x86 you will be able to inject only x86 DLL's into x86 processes.
## It's detectable
There are a lot of ways to detect this injector, or internals in general.
If you bypassed anti-cheats using this injector — probably that was not an Anti-Cheat 😄
## Usage
1) Write any existing window name (Untitled - Notepad for notepad.exe) and press Enter
2) Write absolute DLL path (or drag and drop DLL) and press Enter
## Disclaimer
This is a universal injector that allows you to inject some dll into some application.
It is only a development tool and **you are responsible for it's use**.
### PS:
Some non-professional anti-cheats block applications by it's hash – you know what to do 😘 —
